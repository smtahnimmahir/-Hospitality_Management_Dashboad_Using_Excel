# Hospitality Management Dashboad Using Excel

Welcome to the **Hospitality Management Dashboard** project! This Excel-based dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of cancellation rates for a resort, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding booking management and customer retention.

## Project Overview

The **Hospitality Management Dashboard** is designed to visualize key metrics related to reservation cancellations, room rates, and trends over time. This interactive dashboard helps hospitality managers understand the dynamics of cancellations and optimize their pricing strategies accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Trend of Cancellation and Average Room Rate**: Displays the monthly trend of cancellations and average daily rates from January to August 2017, enabling users to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
- **Number of Cancellations by Lead Time**: A bar chart that illustrates the total cancellations categorized by lead time, providing insights into when guests typically cancel their bookings.
- **Average Daily Rate by Lead Time**: Highlights the average daily rates associated with different lead times, assisting in pricing strategy formulation.
- **Cancellation Rate by Lead Time**: Displays cancellation rates segmented by lead time, offering a clear view of how advance booking affects cancellations.

### Data Insights

- **Total Cancellations**: The dashboard shows a total of 1,590 cancellations, with 259 cancellations occurring within a lead time of less than 30 days.
- **Average Daily Rate**: The average daily rate for the resort during the observed period is shown, with specific metrics for different lead times.
- **Cancellation Rate**: The cancellation rate by lead time indicates that cancellations within a 30-day lead time have a significantly higher percentage (37.7%) compared to those with longer lead times (11.5%).

### Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: For creating the dashboard and visualizations using built-in features like charts, conditional formatting, and data analysis tools.

### Future Enhancements

- Implement advanced analytics to predict cancellation trends using historical data.
- Include additional metrics such as customer demographics to enhance insights.
- Expand the dashboard to cover more months or years for broader trend analysis.
